Python Code CSV to RDF Converter
The "simple" version makes a simple RDF file
The "tests" version makes an RDF file with nested descriptions

To Run:
	pandas and rdflib are required to run
	
	if python is already installed:
		in cmd window do:
			pip install pandas
			pip install rdflib

	if python is not installed:
		I recommend dowloading anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
		pandas is already installed on anaconda
		in anaconda cmd window:
			pip install rdflib
